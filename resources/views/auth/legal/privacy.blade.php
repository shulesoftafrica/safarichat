    <h3><strong>1. DEFINITIONS</strong></h3>



    <p>In the text, we use specific data protection terms, and their definitions are the following:</p>



    <p>The term <strong>“DikoDiko”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong> or <strong>“we”</strong> or <strong>“our”</strong> refers to the company <strong>DikoDiko LIMITED</strong>, with its registered office at the United Kingdom, London SW1Y 6AW, 5th Floor, 86 Jermyn Street and registration number 7085757, as well as to its <strong>subsidiaries and</strong> <strong>affiliates</strong> (the full list of DikoDiko subsidiaries and affiliates with contact details can be found at: <a href="https://www.dikodiko.africa">https://www.dikodiko.africa</a>).</p>



    <p>The term <strong>“GDPR”</strong> means the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC).</p>



    <p>The term <strong>“personal data”</strong> means any information about you by which you can be identified, directly or indirectly.</p>



    <p>The term <strong>“controller”</strong> means the natural or legal person which determines the purposes and means of the data processing and is responsible for processing such data in a manner consistent with the GDPR and other applicable European and national regulations on personal data protection.</p>



    <p>The term <strong>“processor“</strong> means a natural or legal person who processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>



    <p>The term <strong>“Services”</strong> means DikoDiko’s cloud-based communication products and services (CPaaS – Communications Platform as a Services and CCaaS – Contact Centre as a Services).</p>



    <p>The term <strong>“you”</strong> refers to a natural person (an individual) whose personal data DikoDiko collects and processes.</p>



    <h3><strong>2. ABOUT DikoDiko SERVICES</strong></h3>



    <p>DikoDiko is a Communications Platform as a Services (CPaaS) and Contact Centre as a Services (CCaaS) provider. While providing Services to our customers and processing personal data, we act either as the controller or the processor, depending on the situation.</p>



    <p>Our customers are mainly companies that integrate our Services into their business operations through their own software applications (via API) or using DikoDiko Portal (CUP), our website interface. By using our cloud communications platform, our customers are able to send or exchange their communications with their end users using different communication channels (for example, SMS, email, Voice). We are not in direct relationship with our customers’ end users, so we will distribute these communications through telecom operators and other communications providers.</p>



    <p>We act as the processor when processing personal data of individuals on behalf of our customers, and for the sole purpose of providing our Services to them. We do that within limits and according to customers’ instructions and in line with the Service terms and conditions, agreement for Services and/or data processing agreement concluded with the customer.</p>



    <p>For example, when you, as an end user of our customer are the recipient of communication that our customer sent you by using our platform (such as an SMS message), we send that customer’s communications acting on behalf of our customer. That means that the customer is the controller, and DikoDiko is the processor.</p>



    <p>Any request we may receive from customers’ end users regarding their rights related to our activities taken on behalf of our customers will be forwarded to customers, or the end users will be asked to contact them directly.</p>



    <p>In situations when we process personal data for our own purposes and do not act on behalf of someone else, we act as the controller and we are committed to processing that data as described in this Privacy Notice and respecting all obligations arising from the GDPR and other applicable data protection legislation.</p>



    <h3><strong>3. CONTROLLER’S CONTACT DETAILS</strong></h3>



    <p>DikoDiko LIMITED, 86 Jermyn Street 5th Floor, London SW1Y 6AW, United Kingdom</p>

    <p><strong>5.1. When we provide the Services to our customers</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p><strong>5.1.1. To create the customer’s account and enable the customer to start using our Services:</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p><strong>What personal data do we collect?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect customer’s <strong>“account data”</strong>, which is data that relates to the customer’s relationship with DikoDiko.</p>



    <p>If you sign up for our Services, in order to create a customer’s <strong>“account”</strong> we ask for your name, contact details (e.g., phone number, email address, country), and certain related information such as your company’s name, industry and your business role, as well as your login details (e.g., username and password, or API key).</p>



    <p>We also collect names, contact details and login details of customer’s personnel or any other individual authorised by the customer to log into and utilise our Services connected with the customer’s account (a <strong>“user”</strong> of the customer’s account).</p>



    <p>Within the customer’s account we also collect billing information (such as billing address, information on whether the customer is a legal entity or an individual, prepaid or postpaid subscriber, and further information if we are legally required to, and depending on each country’s legislation).</p>



    <p>When doing business with legal persons, we may collect personal data (such as name, business contact details, position in the company) related to their representatives and other personnel that will be our contact points.</p>



    <p>Collecting your name, contact details, login details, and billing information <strong>is necessary</strong> for us in order to enter into an agreement for Services with you. Therefore, we will not be able to provide you with our Services without collecting this basic information. If you sign up for a free trial account, you are not required to enter your billing information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our Services.</p>



    <p><strong>How do we collect personal data?</strong></p>



    <p>If you are our customer as an individual, we obtain this data directly from you. If your organisation is our customer, we may obtain your personal data either directly from you or via your organisation.</p>



    <p>Why do we collect personal data, under which legal basis, and how do we use it?</p>



    <p>We collect and use collected data for agreement signing and agreement administration purposes, to create your account and enable you to access and use our Services, to keep your account secure, to provide you with customer care and technical support, to share relevant information about our products and services and to exercise our rights and fulfil our obligations arising from the business relationship that we may have with you or with your organisation.</p>



    <p>Conducting these activities is our legitimate interest according to GDPR article 6.1.(f) in the sense of providing our Services to your organisation. However, if you personally are our contractual counterpart, we process your data because it is necessary for the performance of an agreement for Services, or in order to take steps, at your request, prior to entering into the agreement in accordance with GDPR article 6.1.(b).</p>



    <p><strong>5.1.2. To enable customers to exchange their co</strong><strong>mmunications by the use of</strong><strong> our Services and to ensure the security of our network and Services:</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p><strong>What data do we collect?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect <strong>traffic data</strong>. Traffic data is data that is processed for the conveyance of a communication exchanged by using our Services or for billing related to that communication, and it includes data on the routing, type, duration, and time of the communication. So, this data encompasses data used to trace and identify the source and destination of a communication (including customer end user’s telephone number or email address, depending on the Service provided).</p>



    <p>We also collect the commands your application communicates to DikoDiko (such as your IP addresses, information on your usage, routing information), as well as logs on your activities created during your use of our tools and Services and we connect this information with your account details.</p>



    <p><strong>How do we collect this data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We receive the customer’s end user’s telephone number or email addresses from our customer, while other traffic data are automatically generated or unveiled during the process of conveyance of a communication.</p>



    <p>We collect data related to your activities on our platform directly from you when you use our Services.</p>



    <p><strong>Why do we collect this data, under which legal bas</strong><strong>is, and how do we use it?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect and process traffic data to provide customers with our Services, that is, to manage traffic with the purpose of transmitting customer’s communications toward or from telecom operators and other communication networks, in order to handle customer’s enquiries and to calculate charges.</p>



    <p>If you, as our customer, are an individual, we rely on GDPR article 6.1. (b) for these processing activities, since it is necessary for the performance of our agreement for Services. If our customer is a legal person, we rely on our legitimate interest (GDPR article 6.1.(f)).</p>



    <p>We also process traffic data to prevent spam and fraud, for troubleshooting and detecting problems with the network, and to settle interconnection payments with telecom operators and other communications providers. Should we have a billing dispute with our customer or with telecoms or other communications providers, we may need to use traffic data related to routing (including the end user’s telephone number or email address, as well as the customer’s IP address) in order to resolve it. The carrying out of these activities is our legitimate interest in the sense of GDPR article 6.1.(f).</p>



    <p>In order to comply with our legal obligations (article 6.1.(c) GDPR), we may be obliged to retain records containing communications related data as stipulated in the relevant national data retention provisions regulating the law enforcement matter, and to share them upon government request.</p>



    <p>We collect logs on your activities created during your use of our Services and connect this information with the customer’s account details in order to secure customer’s account, to prevent or detect fraudulent activities, and to ensure the security of the DikoDiko network. This information is necessary to construct the timeframe of user’s activities in the case of security-related incidents, and to be able to take adequate steps for mitigation. IT security is crucial for us, so for these activities we rely on our legitimate interest and on the legitimate interest of our customers (GDPR article 6.1.(f)) to maintain and improve the security of our network and Services.</p>



    <p><strong>5.1.3. To improve our products and Services</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p><strong>What data do we collect?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect the data you generate during your activity on our platform (e.g. your behaviour records inside our web interface, such as time spent, pages visited, history of your visits and features used).</p>



    <p><strong>How do we collect this data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We obtain this data directly from you. When you browse our website and use our Services, we automatically collect data by placing necessary cookies and trusted tracking technologies on your browser. For more information on how we collect you data through cookies, please visit our <a href="https://www.dikodiko.com/policies/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></a>.</p>



    <p><strong>Why do we collect this data, under which legal basis, and how do we use it?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>The information we collect helps us maintain and improve our website and business. It usually includes your IP address, browser type, the pages you have visited and the order you visited them in as well as whether you are a new or a returning visitor.</p>



    <p>If you are already our customer, we’ll use the data collected from your account to gain insight into the way you use our platform and Services, what your business needs are, past support issues, and so on. This information makes it possible for us to tailor our assistance and product offers and provide the best possible support.</p>



    <p>We analyse your activities on our platform and collect data that is useful for the improvement of our products and Services, relying on our legitimate interest in accordance with GDPR Article 6.1.(f). &nbsp;This may include using your personal information to create de-identified and / or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, information about the device from which you access our Services or other de-identified analyses we create. We take partially automated measurements that include human intervention in order to analyse the way you use the features and tools available on our platform (e.g., by tracking and recording your behaviour inside our web interface, including time spent, pages visited and features used) in order to give you recommendations to improve your performance (e.g. how to better access some feature). Also, we create statistics on the use of our tools to understand which tools have a user-friendly design and which should be enhanced. The general goal of such activities is to enhance your and your company’s messaging execution when communicating with your end users.</p>



    <p><strong>How long do we keep your personal data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>If you as our customer are an individual, we will erase all personal information collected about you within 12 months after the end of the provision of our Services, except the data that we need to keep to comply with our legal obligations arising from financial and tax laws and regulations. For that reason, personal data related to your account such as your name and contact details, billing details as well as an agreement for Services and billing documentation will be kept for a period defined by applicable tax and financial legislation.</p>



    <p>In the case our customer is a legal person, all personal data collected within the customer’s account will be kept in a form that can identify an individual (such as names and contact details of customer’s personnel contact points obtained from the customer) for 12 months after the end of the provision of the Services.</p>



    <p>Your requests and other communication exchanged with our support team via our help desk (support ticketing) system may be kept for three years after the end of the provision of the Services.</p>



    <p>Traffic data will be kept in accordance with the applicable national legislation regulating retention of data in electronic communications for law enforcement purposes. As we may need to keep traffic data in order to calculate charges, we will keep them for billing and to settle our payments towards telecoms and other communications providers until payments are settled, the longest until the end of the period during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payment pursued. In case that a bill remains unpaid or has been challenged before being paid, we will keep data to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights, the longest until the court or other legal procedure is finally closed.</p>



    <p>Behaviour analytics i.e. data generated during your activity on our platform are kept for twenty- five months.</p>



    <p>In case that legal matters such as litigation, law enforcement requests or government investigations acquire us to preserve records, including those containing personal information, we will delete the impacted records when no longer legally obligated to retain them.</p>



    <p><strong>5.2. When you provide your products or services to us</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p><strong>What personal data do we collect?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>If you as our supplier are an individual, we collect your name, contact details (such as address, phone number, email address), certain related information such as your company’s name, industry and your business role, and your billing information (e.g., billing address, information on whether you are a business or an individual, your VAT number, bank account details, and further information if we are legally required to and in accordance with applicable national legislation).</p>



    <p>Collecting this data is necessary for us in order to enter into an agreement with you. Therefore, we will not be able to purchase your products or services without collecting this personal data.</p>



    <p>When doing business with legal entities, we collect personal data related to their representatives and other personnel that will be our contact points (such as their name, business contact details, position in the company).</p>



    <p><strong>How do we collect personal data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>If you as an individual are our supplier, we obtain this data directly from you. If your organisation is our supplier, we may obtain your personal data either directly from you or via your organisation.</p>



    <p><strong>Why do we collect personal data, under which legal basis, and how do we use it?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect and will use this data for agreement signing and agreement administration purposes, to maintain and improve our business relationship, to get relevant information about our supplier’s product or services, or to share relevant information about our business and services with you, as well as to exercise our rights and fulfil our obligations arising from the business relationship that we may have with you or your organisation.</p>



    <p>Conducting these activities is our legitimate interest according to GDPR article 6.1.(f) in the sense of purchasing products or services from a supplier that is a legal person. However, if you personally are our contractual counterpart, we process your personal data because it is necessary for the performance of an agreement or in order to take steps, at your request, prior to entering into an agreement in accordance with GDPR article 6.1.(b).</p>



    <p><strong>How long do we keep your personal data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>If you as our supplier are an individual, we will keep your personal data collected when entering into an agreement (such as your name, contact details, billing details, as well as the agreement concluded with you and billing documentation) for a period defined by applicable tax and financial legislation.</p>



    <p>Your requests and other communication exchanged with our support team via our help desk (support ticketing) system will be kept for three years after the end of the agreement.</p>



    <p>If our supplier is a legal person, personal data of the supplier’s personnel that were our contact points during the business relationship we had obtained from our supplier will be deleted or made anonymous within 12 months after the end of the provision of the Services.</p>



    <p>If legal matters such as litigation, law enforcement requests or government investigations require us to preserve records, including those containing personal information, we will delete the records in question when we are no longer legally obligated to retain them.</p>



    <p><strong>5.3. When you contact us with a question about our products and services and when we are looking for new business opportunities</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p><strong>What personal data do we collect?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We may collect your name and basic contact and business information such as your email address, phone number, country, company, industry, and business role. We will also collect any other information you choose to send us, depending on the nature of our communication.</p>



    <p><strong>How do we collect your personal data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We may collect this information directly from you through our “Contact Sales” or other forms available on our website. After submitting your details, we will send you an email to confirm that our sales team will contact you.</p>

    <p>We are constantly searching for new business opportunities. Therefore, we may collect your contact and business information indirectly, through business and professional networks and databases (such as LinkedIn) or we may employ third parties that supply us with information collected from publicly available sources and data enrichment providers. We only retain the information that will help us reach potential customers and suppliers that could benefit from our services and products, or if we are interested in their products and services.</p>



    <p><strong>Why do we collect personal data, under which legal basis, and how do we use it?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect this information to contact you, answer your questions, and to find out if you or your organisation are interested in further cooperation with us.</p>

Any further processing of your personal data will be based on the business relationship established with you or your organisation and on the lawful processing ground.</p>



    <p>Such activities represent our legitimate interest in accordance with GDPR article 6.1.(f).</p>



    <p>If there will be a mutual interest in entering into an agreement, we will process your personal data within the presales and purchasing process to ensure adequate technical and administrative support (tender procedures, negotiating, and concluding agreements). In accordance with GDPR article 6.1.(f), it is our legitimate interest to conduct this process properly. If you personally are our contractual counterpart (as an individual), we process your data because it is necessary for the performance of a contract or in order to take steps, at your request, prior to entering into a contract in accordance with GDPR article 6.1.(b).</p>



    <p><strong>How long do we keep your personal data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>If we do not enter into an agreement, we will delete your personal data collected for this purpose within six months after our last communication.</p>

    <p><strong>5.4. When we send you our email marketing communica</strong><strong>tions</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p><strong>What personal data do we collect?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect your name and email address.</p>



    <p><strong>How do we collect personal data?</strong></p>



    <p>We collect this information directly from you if you subscribe to receive our newsletters, blogs or our other email marketing communication by which we provide the information about our business and services. This data is collected through the webforms available on our website.</p>



    <p>For business to business (B2B) marketing, if we have an existing business relationship (our customers, suppliers and their staff), we may use data collected from you or your organisation when entering into an agreement or during our business relationship.</p>



    <p><strong>Why do we collect personal data, under which legal basis, and how do we use it?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>Our purpose for collecting the information is the provision of the services to you and informing you about news, webinars and upcoming events.</p>



    <p>We use your details only to provide these services. We also gather statistics around email opening and clicks using industry standard technologies, including clear gifs to help us improve our e-newsletter.</p>



    <p>If you subscribe to our email marketing communication, we rely on your consent (Article 6.1.(a) GDPR) provided to us when submitting such webforms. You will receive a confirmation email once you have submitted your details.</p>



    <p>For B2B (business to business) direct marketing, we may rely on our legitimate interest in accordance with GDPR article 6.1.(f). For the purpose of maintaining and improving our business relationship, it is our legitimate interest to inform our existing business partners (customers and suppliers, including their staff) about our products and services, news, webinars, and upcoming events via email newsletters, blogs or other forms of email communication.</p>



    <p>In any case, you may proactively manage your preferences or opt-out of communications (unsubscribe) with DikoDiko at any time using the unsubscribe link provided in all DikoDiko’s email marketing communications. In case that you have unsubscribed from our marketing communications (i.e. withdraw your consent or object to the processing) we will stop sending you any marketing materials.</p>



    <p>However, we maintain a so-called “suppression list” that contains only your email address just to be sure that we will not contact you with unwanted content in the future. We retain this information relying on our legitimate interest (article 6.1(f) GDPR).</p>

    <p>We may also ask you information about the time and place of your arrival as well as accommodation details and dietary requirements you may have.</p>



    <p>If you require us to provide you with an invitation or support letter, or you need to get letter of guarantee to be able to get a visa, we will collect the necessary information required by applicable law (such as your name, address, date of birth, passport details).</p>

    <p>Sometimes your organisation will send us your contact details to attend our event on their behalf, and we will send you an invitation with the link for registration.</p>



    <p><strong>Why do we collect personal data, under which legal basis, and how do we use it?</strong></p>



    <p>If you register for a webinar, we will use your contact details to provide you with the webinar details in advance, to remind you of the webinar and email you the recording of the webinar subsequently.</p>

    <p>The legal basis we rely on for processing your personal data is your consent under article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR, provided when you submit your details through our registration forms. When we collect any information about dietary requirements, we also rely on your consent (under article 9(2)(a)) as this type of information is classified as a special category of personal data.</p>



    <p>If you will need an invitation or support letter or letter of guarantee to be able to get a visa, we have to collect the necessary information about you as defined by the applicable legislation. We collect this information just to respond to your request and support you with the necessary documentation and we rely on your consent (article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR) provided when you submit us your personal data for this purpose. Such information will not be processed for any other purpose than issuing such a document upon your request.

    <p>We also keep events’ participants lists containing only your name, contact details, your company’s name, industry and your business role. In this case, the processing purpose is to maintain a list of former participants in order to invite them to future events we consider they might be interested in. To be able to stay in touch with you, invite you to our other events, and inform you about our products and services, we rely on our legitimate interest in accordance with GDPR article 6.1.(f).

    <p><strong>What personal data do we collect?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We collect your name and contact information (email address). The idea of the researches we conduct is to gather anonymous information. Therefore, our intention is to collect only your personal data necessary to send you a questionnaire but not to link the anonymous answers with you in any way.</p>

    <p>Firstly, we invite you to take a survey sending a generic untraceable URL to a survey questionnaire. If you decide to participate and answer our questions, we will not ask you to unveil any personal data, and our intention is to keep the answers anonymous.</p>



    <p>When searching for your email address, we rely on our legitimate interest in accordance with GDPR Art. 6.1.(f). Our intention is to collect anonymous information. However, if you disclose any information about you in your answers, we will rely on your consent in accordance with GDPR Art. 6.1.(a).</p>



    <p>Keep in mind that we respect your privacy rights, so we do not carry out any activity to link the answers provided with you, and we do not inform other organisations (e.g. your employer) on the answers you provided in any way.</p>



    <p><strong>How long do we keep your personal data?</strong><strong></strong></p>



    <p>We will process the answers you provided in order to have general feedback on our products and services.

    <p>If you do not submit your resume directly into our recruitment software (e.g. when you send it to a staff member who is your referee, when we receive it from a recruitment agency, or we find your professional details on business networking sites you use), we will send you an email with a link to our recruitment software and you will be asked to provide us your consent to keep your personal data for recruitment purposes.
